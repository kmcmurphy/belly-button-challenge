# Belly Button Biodiversity

Have you ever wondered what's really growing in the unwashed belly button? For this project, I examined a dataset of the various microbes that live in the human navel. The data was plotted to an interactive dashboard, which updates as a new test subject is selected from the drop-down menu. 

Visualizations include:
- A table with demographic information on the subject
- The top 10 microbe species present
- A bubble chart of all microbes present
- A guage showing the frequency the subject washes their navel

Overall, it's surprising the infrequency that some people wash their belly buttons!
